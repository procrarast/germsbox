# germsbox
Simple multibox extension for Germs.io.

The "a" key is set by default to switch between windows. If one is not already open, one will be opened for you.

# TODO
Below is a list of features set to be released sometime in the future.
- When a new window is opened, open from the same party URL provided by the parent tab.
- When switching between windows, send a 'keyup' event for the feed key.
- Validate that the user hasn't opened three or more Germs.io windows.
- Add persistent configuration to popup and save in browser storage for:
  - enabling/disabling switching
  - sending feed 'keyup' before/after switching tabs
  - setting the tab switch keycode
  - window opacity
